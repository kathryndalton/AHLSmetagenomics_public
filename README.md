# Current Plan for AHLS Metagenomic Data

## Step 1 import datasets, clean and explore variables
## Step 2 do alpha diversity descriptive tests and models, explore model development
## Step 3 do beta diversity PCOAs and permanova models
## Step 4 differential relative abundance via ANCOMBC (vs DESeq??, both??)
## Step 5 add in new variables = pesticides, CAFO distance, other covariates in AHLS, +/- BEEA study variables
## Step 6 plan for EWAS-diversity association 
## Step 7 ??

Project Goal:

1) Redo similar associations to Mikyeong's Exposure paper (https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/full/10.1289/EHP3145) - see if the addition of WGS adds to the detection / interpretation
2) Explore other co-vairates of interest in larger AHS dataset (and or new variables in BEEA cohort), examples pesticides, distance to CAFOs
3) Metagenomics - Epigenomics asscociation, compare diversity levels to EWAS data, +/- add endotoxin level
    --- discuss with Ziyue about technique to compare abundance data to EWAS data
